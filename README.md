# PortfolioProjects
This repo is dedicated to all the files relating to portfolio projects I have created.
It consists of Microsoft SQL Server query files and python files from Jupyter Notebook.

# Amazon Web Scraper Project

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to use Python to make a script capable of extracting data from a website and importing it into an Excel file. I used BeautifulSoup in order to grab objects from the website. 

A cool feature is included where I will receive an email if the product's price drops below a certain point.

# Indian E-commerce sales data analysis project

For this project, I sourced a public dataset from kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/ecommerce-data)

I cleaned up the data a little bit, did a lot of exploration and created a few dashboards on tableau. (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dan.weinstein/viz/E-commerceSalesDataAnalysis/QuantitySoldDash)

# Movie data correlation project

For this project, I sourced a public dataset from kaggle:
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)

I used Python to see if there was any relationship between the variables and the ratings. I created scatter plots with regression lines and different correlation matrixes. I also quantified features like genre, country and company to include them inside the matrixes.
